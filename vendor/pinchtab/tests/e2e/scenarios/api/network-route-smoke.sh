# network-route-smoke.sh — End-to-end interception against a real Chrome.
# Verifies abort / fulfill / inverted-allowlist behaviour when a page
# actually issues fetches. Slower than the extended scenario; tagged "smoke".
#
# Cross-origin caveat: fulfill responses are deliberately not decorated with
# CORS headers (that would be the bypass we are guarding against). Under the
# default fetch mode 'cors', a missing ACAO would reject the page promise
# with a TypeError — indistinguishable from a real DNS failure — so the page
# shim uses mode:'no-cors' to get an opaque resolution instead. "Rule fired"
# is then detected by the absence of a thrown error. Same-origin fulfill
# (which under the inverted policy is always blocked, because the page must
# be on an allowlisted host) is verified by reading the response body.
