// idpiDomainBlockedCode is the one code every IDPI domain block reports, so a
// client can switch on it whether the tab drifted, a requested URL was refused,
// or a navigation was blocked. The nav site used to answer with the generic
// "error" code, which left the most common way to hit the allowlist as the one
// case a consumer could not classify.

// The drifted-tab block describes where the tab IS, not what the caller asked
// for, so its remedy must not name the allowlist: widening it is precisely the
// change the operator's allowlist exists to prevent, and an agent that follows
// that lead erodes the posture instead of recovering. Going back does recover —
// no navigation or history endpoint consults this guard, so `back` can always
// reach a tab the read verbs have locked out.
