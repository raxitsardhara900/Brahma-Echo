// whose help no longer claims cookies as its job. The CLI is the token-cheap surface the
// skill steers agents toward, so a namespace present on the other two surfaces and absent
// here sends the agent to curl.
//
// Deliberately NOT "every namespace must be documented": measured against the tree, the
// CLI reference is a curated subset (roughly a third of the leaf verbs have no section),
// so that rule would assert a contract this repo does not have and would red for a dozen
// commands no card was filed about. Cross-surface parity is the narrower claim that is
// actually true and actually the defect.

// knownCrossSurfaceGaps is checked in BOTH directions, so it cannot go quiet: a NEW gap
// reds, and an entry whose namespace has since been documented reds as stale. Every entry
// carries what a reader needs to close it.
