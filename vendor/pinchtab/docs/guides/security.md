# Security

PinchTab is designed to be usable by default on a local machine without exposing high-risk browser control features unless you explicitly turn them on.

PinchTab's default and primary deployment model is local-first: one user, one machine, one operator-controlled browser control plane. More complex topologies such as Docker, LAN access, remote bridges, or distributed orchestrator setups are supported, but they are advanced deployments. PinchTab should not be treated as a turnkey internet-facing service, and securing those deployments is the operator's responsibility.

If you run PinchTab on a different machine, do so only if you understand the security model you are operating. Prefer a private or otherwise closed network, avoid exposing the service directly to the public internet, and keep high-risk capabilities disabled unless they are required for that deployment. If they must be enabled, restrict them so only the minimum trusted systems that need them can reach them.

> [!WARNING]
> PinchTab's dashboard, HTTP API, remote CLI targeting, MCP integrations, and automation routes are all part of the same privileged control plane. They are intended for trusted operators and trusted systems only. Do not expose them to untrusted users, untrusted client systems, or the public internet.
>
> If you are unsure whether a non-local or partially exposed deployment is safe, do not expose it yet. Review this guide first and use the private security contact path in `SECURITY.md` before proceeding.

The default security posture is:

- `server.bind = 127.0.0.1`
- `server.token` is generated during default setup and should remain set
- `security.allowEvaluate = false`
- `security.allowMacro = false`
- `security.allowScreencast = false`
- `security.allowDownload = false`
- `security.allowCookies = false`
- `security.allowUpload = false`
- `autoSolver.enabled = false`
- `instanceDefaults.stealthLevel = "light"` (minimal fingerprint normalization only; anti-bot bypass requires explicit opt-in to `medium` or `full`)
- `security.attach.enabled = false`
- `security.attach.allowHosts = ["127.0.0.1", "localhost", "::1"]`
- `security.attach.allowSchemes = ["ws", "wss", "http", "https"]`
- `security.attach.forwardProxyAuth = false`
- `security.allowedDomains = ["127.0.0.1", "localhost", "::1"]`
- `security.trustedProxyCIDRs = []`
- `security.trustedResolveCIDRs = []`
- `security.idpi.enabled = true`
- `security.idpi.strictMode = true`
- `security.idpi.scanContent = true`
- `security.idpi.wrapContent = true`

Use `pinchtab security` to review the current posture and restore the recommended defaults.

## Security Philosophy

PinchTab follows a few simple rules:

- default to local-only access
- default dangerous capabilities to off
- separate transport access from feature exposure
- fail closed when content or domain trust cannot be established

This means there are two independent questions:

1. who can reach the server
2. what the server is allowed to do once reached

Both matter.

## Trust Boundary

The important operational rule is simple:

- if a person or system should not be allowed to control browser state, profiles, configuration, attachments, or sensitive endpoint families, it should not be able to reach PinchTab and it should not be given credentials for PinchTab

That includes:

- the browser dashboard
- direct HTTP API clients
- CLI usage against a remote server with `--server`
- MCP clients, plugins, scripts, and other automation layers built on top of the API

These are different interfaces to the same control plane, not separate trust domains.

## Advanced Deployments

If you intentionally run PinchTab beyond the default local setup, the minimum operator checklist is:

- keep `server.token` set to a strong random value
- narrow network reachability with a trusted network boundary, VPN, firewall, or reverse proxy
- add TLS at the proxy or transport layer when traffic leaves the local machine
- enable `server.trustProxyHeaders` only when a trusted reverse proxy is actually stripping and rebuilding `Forwarded` / `X-Forwarded-*` headers for you
- keep sensitive endpoint families disabled unless they are explicitly needed, and if they are enabled, restrict them to the minimum trusted callers or network paths that must reach them
- scope `security.attach` and `security.idpi` deliberately for the remote topology you are operating

Those choices are deployment responsibilities, not defaults that PinchTab can infer safely on your behalf.

When the server is not running on the same machine as the user or agent, the bar should be higher: know which hosts can reach it, know which credentials protect it, know which endpoint families are enabled, and know which network boundary is containing it.

Binding to loopback reduces who can reach the API. Tokens reduce who can use it successfully. Sensitive endpoint gates reduce what a successful caller can do. IDPI reduces which websites and extracted content are trusted enough to pass deeper into an agent workflow.

## API Token

`server.token` is the master API token.

For non-browser clients, requests should send:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The browser dashboard uses a different flow:

1. the user enters the token once on the login page
2. the server exchanges it for a same-origin `HttpOnly` session cookie
3. sensitive dashboard actions can require token re-entry for short-lived
   elevation

By default, PinchTab auto-detects whether the dashboard session cookie should
use the `Secure` flag. In `auto` mode, HTTPS requests get `Secure` cookies and
plain HTTP requests do not.

That means:

- reverse-proxied HTTPS keeps `Secure` enabled
- plain `http://localhost:9867` keeps working for local-only use
- plain `http://192.168.x.x:9867` or `http://10.x.x.x:9867` works, but the
  dashboard warns that the session is running over insecure HTTP

If you want to require HTTPS for dashboard login, force `server.cookieSecure`
to `true`:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "cookieSecure": true
  }
}
```

On plain HTTP, that now fails explicitly with an HTTPS-required login error
instead of appearing to succeed and then looping.

If you intentionally need plain HTTP on a trusted LAN, you can also force
`cookieSecure` off explicitly:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "cookieSecure": false
  }
}
```

Recommended usage:

- leave `cookieSecure` unset (`auto`) unless you have a reason to override it
- use `cookieSecure: true` when TLS is in front of PinchTab
- only use `cookieSecure: false` on operator-controlled plain-HTTP deployments
- if TLS terminates at a trusted reverse proxy, enable
  `server.trustProxyHeaders` so forwarded HTTPS requests are recognized

Why this matters:

- without a token, any process that can reach the server can call the API
- on `127.0.0.1`, that still includes local scripts, browser pages, other users on the same machine, and malware
- on `0.0.0.0` or a LAN bind, a missing token is a much bigger risk

Recommended practice:

- keep `server.bind` on `127.0.0.1`
- set a strong random `server.token`
- only widen the bind when remote access is intentional

`pinchtab config init` generates and stores a token as part of the default setup:

```bash
pinchtab config init
```

The dashboard Settings page does not expose or rotate `server.token`. Use `pinchtab config token` to copy the current token, or let `pinchtab security` restore or create one if `server.token` is empty.

If you are calling the API manually:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://127.0.0.1:9867/health
```

CLI commands use the configured local server settings by default, and `PINCHTAB_TOKEN` can override the token for a single shell session.

## Agent Sessions

Agent sessions are reduced-distribution credentials for trusted automation, not a sandbox for untrusted clients.

- session-authenticated callers are blocked from dashboard/admin endpoint families such as config, session management, profile management, instance management, dashboard agent listings, and cache controls
- session records can optionally carry explicit grants that narrow access further
- sessions without explicit grants can still use the normal non-admin automation API by default

That means agent sessions are appropriate for controlled environments where the caller is already trusted to drive browser automation but should not receive the full dashboard bearer token. They are not sufficient for hostile multi-tenant sharing or public internet exposure. For that kind of isolation, run separate PinchTab instances behind separate network and credential boundaries.

## Sensitive Endpoints

Some endpoint families expose much more power than normal navigation and inspection. PinchTab keeps them disabled by default:

- `security.allowEvaluate`
- `security.allowMacro`
- `security.allowScreencast`
- `security.allowDownload`
- `security.allowCookies`
- `security.allowUpload`
- `security.allowFileScheme`

Why they are considered dangerous:

- `evaluate` can execute JavaScript in page context
- `macro` can trigger higher-level automation flows
- `screencast` can stream live page contents
- `download` can fetch and persist remote content. When `security.downloadAllowedDomains` is set, listed domains bypass private-IP SSRF checks (intended for internal hosts such as Docker services). `["*"]` matches every host and disables all private-IP protection on the download endpoint.
- `cookies` can read, write, or clear browser session tokens for the current page
- `upload` can push local files into browser flows
- `allowFileScheme` permits navigation to `file://` URLs. Because a `file://` URL has no host, it is **not** subject to `allowedDomains` or the SSRF/private-IP guard, so enabling it grants read access (via snapshot/screenshot/scrape) to any local file the server process can read. It stays blocked when a strict-mode `allowedDomains` allowlist is active. Enable only on trusted, single-tenant hosts. `javascript:`, `chrome://`, and `data:` remain rejected regardless.

These are not the same as authentication.

- auth decides who may call the API
- sensitive endpoint gates decide which high-risk capabilities exist at all

For example, a token-protected server with `security.allowEvaluate = true` is still intentionally exposing JavaScript execution to any caller that has the token.

When disabled, these routes are locked and return a `403` explaining that the endpoint family is disabled in config.

## Attach Policy

Attach is an advanced feature for registering an externally managed Chrome instance through a CDP URL. It is disabled by default:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "attach": {
      "enabled": false,
      "allowHosts": ["127.0.0.1", "localhost", "::1"],
      "allowSchemes": ["ws", "wss", "http", "https"],
      "forwardProxyAuth": false
    }
  }
}
```

If you enable attach:

- keep `allowHosts` narrowly scoped
- prefer local-only hosts unless external Chrome targets or remote bridges are intentional
- only attach to browsers and CDP endpoints you trust
- `allowHosts: ["*"]` is a documented, non-default, security-reducing override. It disables host allowlisting entirely and allows any reachable attach host with an allowed scheme. Use it only on isolated, operator-controlled networks.
- keep `forwardProxyAuth` disabled unless the attached browser process and CDP transport are trusted; enabling it permits PinchTab to send configured proxy credentials over the CDP WebSocket.

There are two attach endpoints with different trust shapes:

- `POST /instances/attach` — attach an existing **CDP browser** by `cdpUrl`.
  PinchTab spawns a child `pinchtab bridge --cdp-attach ...` process that wraps
  the external endpoint and registers the bridge's local HTTP URL (not the
  raw `ws://` CDP URL) as the routable instance URL. The CDP URL is preserved
  as metadata and **redacted in logs**.
- `POST /instances/attach-bridge` — attach an already-running **PinchTab
  bridge** by its HTTP `baseUrl`. The orchestrator runs a `/health` check
  before registering it.

Scheme allowlist rules:

- `ws`, `wss` — required for CDP attach using a browser WebSocket URL
- `http`, `https` — required for CDP attach using an HTTP DevTools origin
  *and* for `POST /instances/attach-bridge`

`security.attach.allowSchemes` and `security.attach.enabled` still apply when `allowHosts` contains `"*"`, but host allowlisting no longer provides protection in that configuration.

For `attach-bridge`, `baseUrl` should be a bare bridge origin such as `http://bridge.internal:9868`. Do not include credentials, query strings, fragments, or a path. For CDP attach via HTTP, only the bare origin or a `/json/version` path is accepted.

Stopping a CDP-attached instance shuts down the child PinchTab bridge but never kills the external browser process — PinchTab does not own that process.

## IDPI

IDPI stands for Indirect Prompt Injection defense.

It exists to reduce the chance that untrusted website content influences downstream agents through hidden instructions, poisoned text, or unsafe navigation.

PinchTab's IDPI layer currently does four things:

- restricts navigation to an allowlist of approved domains
- blocks or warns when a URL cannot be matched against that allowlist
- scans extracted content for suspicious prompt-injection patterns
- wraps text output so downstream systems can treat it as untrusted content

The default local-only IDPI config is:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "allowedDomains": ["127.0.0.1", "localhost", "::1"],
    "trustedProxyCIDRs": [],
    "trustedResolveCIDRs": [],
    "idpi": {
      "enabled": true,
      "strictMode": true,
      "scanContent": true,
      "wrapContent": true,
      "customPatterns": []
    }
  }
}
```

Important notes:

- if `allowedDomains` is empty, the main domain restriction is not doing useful work
- if `allowedDomains` contains `"*"`, the whitelist effectively allows everything
- `security.allowedDomains` is the canonical config path. `security.idpi.allowedDomains` is still accepted when loading older config files, but new saves are normalized to `security.allowedDomains`
- `strictMode = true` blocks disallowed domains and suspicious content
- `strictMode = false` allows the request but emits warnings instead
- `scanContent` protects `/text` and `/snapshot` style extraction paths
- `wrapContent` adds explicit untrusted-content framing for downstream consumers
- widening navigation to non-local or non-trusted sites is still a security-reducing choice; IDPI lowers risk, but it does not make hostile pages safe or remove browser attack surface

For navigation trust overrides:

- `security.trustedResolveCIDRs` lets a hostname resolve to a non-public IP during navigation preflight. This is intended for operator-controlled DNS or proxy setups such as internal proxies, lab networks, or benchmark ranges
- `security.trustedProxyCIDRs` trusts browser-reported remote IPs from known internal proxies during runtime navigation checks
- keep both lists narrow. Broad ranges such as `10.0.0.0/8` reduce SSRF protections and should only be used when the full network segment is intentionally trusted
- known limitation: responses served from the browser cache or a service worker report no remote IP, so the runtime remote-IP check passes them through by design; the resolve-time checks remain the primary gate for those navigations

Supported domain patterns are:

- exact host: `example.com`
- subdomain wildcard: `*.example.com`
- full wildcard: `*`

`*` is convenient, but it defeats the main allowlist defense and should be avoided unless you are deliberately disabling domain restriction.

If you need to widen trust for only one managed browser, prefer an instance-scoped override instead of changing the global server policy. `POST /instances/start`, `POST /instances/launch`, and `POST /profiles/{id}/start` accept:

```json
{
  "securityPolicy": {
    "allowedDomains": ["*"]
  }
}
```

That override is additive for that instance only. For example, you can keep the server baseline local-only and start one temporary instance with `allowedDomains: ["*"]` or a narrow extra host list such as `["wikipedia.org"]` without widening the rest of the server.

## Recommended Config

For a secure local setup:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "bind": "127.0.0.1",
    "token": "replace-with-a-generated-token"
  },
  "security": {
    "allowEvaluate": false,
    "allowMacro": false,
    "allowScreencast": false,
    "allowDownload": false,
    "allowCookies": false,
    "allowUpload": false,
    "allowedDomains": ["127.0.0.1", "localhost", "::1"],
    "trustedProxyCIDRs": [],
    "trustedResolveCIDRs": [],
    "attach": {
      "enabled": false,
      "allowHosts": ["127.0.0.1", "localhost", "::1"],
      "allowSchemes": ["ws", "wss", "http", "https"],
      "forwardProxyAuth": false
    },
    "idpi": {
      "enabled": true,
      "strictMode": true,
      "scanContent": true,
      "wrapContent": true,
      "customPatterns": []
    }
  }
}
```

If you intentionally expose PinchTab beyond localhost, treat the token as mandatory and keep the sensitive endpoint families disabled unless you have a specific reason to enable them. For anything more exposed than a single-machine local setup, assume you are operating an advanced deployment and review each security control explicitly.

## Authenticated Browser Sessions

When agents reuse browser sessions that a human has authenticated (logged-in profiles), follow these practices:

- Use a **dedicated low-privilege profile** — not the user's personal browsing profile
- **Confirm with the user** before performing account-changing actions (password changes, payment, deletion, permissions) in a reused session
- Restrict navigation to the sites needed for the task via `security.allowedDomains` or instance-scoped `securityPolicy.allowedDomains`

These are operational guidelines enforced at the agent/skill layer, not API-level gates. The profile system (`POST /profiles`) supports metadata fields (`name`, `description`, `useWhen`) to help agents select the right profile for the task.

## Daemon Lifecycle

The background daemon is a convenience for persistent local browser control. It runs continuously once installed (`KeepAlive` on macOS, `Restart=always` on Linux).

When browser automation is no longer needed, disable it:

- `pinchtab daemon stop` — stop the service without removing it
- `pinchtab daemon uninstall` — stop, disable, and remove the service file

For short-lived or one-off usage, prefer `pinchtab server` (foreground process, exits when the terminal closes) over the daemon.

Agent session credentials auto-expire after **30 minutes of idle** (`sessions.agent.idleTimeoutSec: 1800`) and have a **24-hour max lifetime** (`sessions.agent.maxLifetimeSec: 86400`) by default.

## Agent Sessions

For automated agents, use **agent sessions** instead of sharing the server bearer token. Each agent gets a dedicated session token (`PINCHTAB_SESSION`) that:

- Maps to a specific `agentId` for activity tracking
- Can be individually revoked without affecting other agents
- Has configurable idle timeout and max lifetime
- Never exposes the server bearer token to agents

**Important:** Agent sessions are designed for trusted environments. The session management API (`/sessions`) has no per-agent authorization — any bearer-authenticated caller can manage all sessions. Do not expose these endpoints to untrusted networks.

See [Reference: Agent Sessions](../reference/sessions.md) for configuration and API details.
