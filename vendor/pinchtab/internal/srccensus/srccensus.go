// Package srccensus is the shared home for this repo's source-scanning census guards.
//
// A census guard pins something ordinary unit tests structurally cannot see: that
// production CALLS the guarded helper rather than reimplementing the rule inline. A unit
// test on the helper stays green while a caller bypasses it, which is the regression shape
// every one of these guards was written after.
//
// # The five properties
//
// Four rounds of these guards have now been written by hand, and the same two mistakes
// recur. Shared here, so they cannot be forgotten:
//
//  1. SCOPE IS DERIVED, NEVER HAND-LISTED. Load enumerates a package's non-test sources
//     and Tree a whole subtree's, rather than naming files, and the finders return EVERY
//     match rather than the first. Tree also owns the walk EXCLUSIONS, so a module-wide
//     guard inherits them instead of each author remembering them.
//     Every silent narrowing found in this repo came from a hand-listed scope — a pair of
//     filenames, the first match per file, a literal list of the very constants whose
//     addition the guard policed. The rule was right in all three; the scope covered less
//     than the message claimed, and no vacuity floor can see that.
//  2. NON-VACUITY IS STRUCTURAL. Load fails when the package yields too few files, and
//     Calls fails when a pattern that must exist matches nothing. A guard whose scan
//     matched nothing passes for the wrong reason, so this is not left to each author.
//     Where zero matches is the PASS condition, CallsAllowingNone says so out loud and the
//     floor has to sit on something else.
//  3. LOCATING A DECLARATION EITHER SUCCEEDS OR REPORTS. Func returns found=false as a
//     value. The hand-rolled shape it replaces sliced from strings.Index and panicked with
//     a bounds error when a helper moved to a sibling file — the one refactor most likely
//     to cause it, answered with the least readable failure.
//  4. EXEMPTION TABLES STAY LOCAL, with the reason at the entry and checked in BOTH
//     directions: a stale exemption naming something that no longer exists must fail too.
//     They are deliberately not shared — the reason belongs beside the rule it excuses.
//  5. FAILURE MESSAGES STAY LOCAL AND SPECIFIC. Naming the file, the line and the fix is
//     most of a census's value, and saying what to do when the guarded shape CHANGED —
//     add the new entry point, or pin the property against whatever replaced it, but do
//     not delete the test — is what stops the next reader deleting it.
//
// This package deliberately holds no rule tables, no exemptions and no messages. It reads
// source with go/ast so a site carries its enclosing function and a real FileSet line; it
// does not decide what is banned.
