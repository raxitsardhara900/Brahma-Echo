// ProfileDir returns a fresh Chrome user-data-dir for a browser-backed test and

// It exists because t.TempDir CANNOT hold a browser profile. Chrome's shutdown is
// asynchronous: when the test body returns the process is often still flushing
// Default/Cache/Cache_Data, so files appear under the tree while t.TempDir's
// RemoveAll is walking it, RemoveAll fails on a directory that was empty when it
// was read, and t.TempDir turns that into a TEST FAILURE. The failure names a
// directory that is "not empty", says nothing about the behaviour under test, and
// lands on whichever browser test lost the race that run — so every reader spends a
// turn proving the red is not theirs.
//
// Removal failure here is logged, never asserted: a leaked temp profile is the
// lesser evil. This tolerance is scoped to browser profiles on purpose — tests that
// launch no browser keep strict t.TempDir cleanup, which is what catches their own
// cleanup bugs.
