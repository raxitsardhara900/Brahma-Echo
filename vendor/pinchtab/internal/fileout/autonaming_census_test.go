// This census lives beside the rule it defends, and it walks the MODULE. Two
// directory-scoped censuses stood here before — one in internal/handlers, one in
// internal/cli/actions — each reading os.ReadDir(".") with its own accounted map. Between
// them they covered the two packages that had the defect and nothing else, so the next
// auto-naming site, in any third package, would have shipped unseen. Walking from the
// module root is the same fix the isolated-world boundary census in internal/bridge got
// after the same blind spot. srccensus.Tree owns the enumeration — the rule stays a
// literal scan over each file's text, but the walk exclusions (including the
// nested-checkout skip a hand-rolled name list missed) are inherited, not remembered.

// timestampLayouts are the second-resolution spellings this census recognises. A stamp is
// what makes two outputs in the same second collide, so the layout is the signal.
//
// STATED BLIND SPOT, because a census that reads as module-wide while checking one
// spelling is worse than one whose limits are written down: colon-bearing layouts
// (15:04:05) and named constants (time.RFC3339, time.DateTime) are NOT scanned. Colons
// are illegal in Windows filenames and vanishingly rare in output names, and the named
// constants are overwhelmingly used to format timestamps for display, where they would
// produce noise on every log line. A filename built from either is an unguarded site.
//
// Coarser-than-second stamps are unscanned too, and this is the limit a reader is most
// likely to guess wrong: a date-only name (Format("20060102")) collides between any two
// outputs on the same DAY, so it is worse than the shapes above rather than safer. It is
// left out because 20060102 opens every layout listed here and appears throughout code
// that names no file, so scanning it would cry wolf everywhere. Nothing in the module
// builds one today; the next one is unguarded.

// autoNamingSites maps a MODULE-RELATIVE path to why its timestamp cannot destroy an
// earlier output. Package-qualified, so one map serves the whole module and a reader can
// see which package each decision belongs to. Every entry is a boundary decision, which
// is why each carries its reason rather than just a path.
//
// The KEYS are checked in both directions; a reason's TEXT is only printed. It is
// documentation for the next reader, not a check, so it rots silently unless someone
// updating a site updates it here too — this entry credited a helper deleted a card ago.
