	Use:   "compare <live-url> <staging-url>",
	Short: "Compare two site versions visually and by audit data",
	Long: `Audit the same pages on a live and a staging base URL, then compare
each pair: pixel-level visual diff on the screenshots plus data drift
(uncaught JS errors, console errors, broken assets, accessibility score,
load time).

Uncaught JS errors drift on identity, not just count: an exception present
on one side only, or swapped for a different one, is a difference. The same
exception on both sides is not — this is a comparison gate, not an absolute
health check.

Pages default to the two base URLs; pass --pages with comma-separated
relative paths to compare more. With --output-dir the comparison report is
written to <dir>/report.json and annotated diff images to <dir>/diffs/.

Differences are data, not failure: the command exits 0 even when pages
differ. Pass --fail-on-diff to exit non-zero when any visual or data diff
exists (CI gate).`,
