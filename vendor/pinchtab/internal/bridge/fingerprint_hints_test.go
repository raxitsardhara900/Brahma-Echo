	// the test's own. Chrome fetches /favicon.ico after each navigation, and those two land
	// between the rows — at a position that moves from run to run. The slot this replaces was
	// written by every one of them, so a row could read a request it never made.
	//
	// The favicons carry the override in effect when they are SENT — they were seen with the
	// windows/edge UA, not a default one — so they are NOT exempt from
	// Network.setUserAgentOverride. What the old capture could hand a row was therefore the
	// PREVIOUS row's persona. Said explicitly because the opposite is easy to assume, and a
	// reader who believes favicons bypass the override will reason wrongly about what any
	// capture like this can see.

	// The reported failure named the browser's own HeadlessChrome default, which can only come
	// from a request issued before ANY override — here, the baseline navigation. That exact
	// ordering was not reproduced, and this comment does not invent one. The structural fact is
