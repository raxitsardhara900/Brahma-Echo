// ForwardRequestID is the one mechanism that decides the request id an instance is told,

// A hop that tells the instance nothing is the reason a phantom id existed: the instance
// found no inbound id, minted its own, and returned it on a response that already carried
// the outer chain's, so a caller could be handed a string that appears in no log on disk.
// Forwarding the outer chain's resolved value instead makes ONE proxied request findable
// by ONE id in both logs.
//
// It is deliberately narrow — this header and no other. A hop that fixed traceability by
// widening into a wholesale request copy would carry the caller's cookie and network
// identity to the instance along with it, which is what the per-hop strip lists exist to
// prevent. Callers that strip this header from their blind copy call this AFTER the strip:
// the two are different permissions, since a copy forwards whatever arrived under that
// name while this forwards the one value the outer chain resolved for this request.
