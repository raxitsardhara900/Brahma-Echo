// Package remedy owns details.remedy, the one field in an error response an agent may act
// on without reading English.
//
// THE PROPERTY. A remedy is ONE line a shell accepts as a single pinchtab invocation, or
// several joined with &&. Prose connectives ("then:", "or", a parenthetical tail), pipes,
// semicolons and redirections are not remedies: `pinchtab dialog accept|dismiss` is not two
// suggestions to a shell, it is a pipeline into a command named dismiss. A free slot is a
// <name> placeholder using the same angle-bracket convention the CLI's own help uses, and
// nothing else. Where the value is known at the point of production it is interpolated
// rather than left as a slot. When there is no single command the field is ABSENT: absence
// says truthfully that no command exists, which a client can handle and a sentence cannot.
//
// Prose belongs in details.hint, which is emitted beside remedy at every site.
//
// WHY AN OWNER. The field previously meant four different things across eight producers —
// executable line, command with a prose tail, bare verb, pure prose — while the CLI printed
// all of them into one "Remedy:" slot. A caller that learned the field is executable from
// one producer mis-executed the rest. Declare is the only way to build one, so a ninth
// producer cannot land in a ninth shape: the line is validated where it is written, and
// every declared line is walked by the guards (its commands resolve against the real
// command tree, and no site assembles the field by hand).
