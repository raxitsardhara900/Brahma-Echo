# Capture

Paired screenshot and accessibility snapshot from the **same DOM epoch** in
one HTTP call. Use this when the model needs to read pixels AND act on refs
in the same turn — the unpaired `/screenshot` + `/snapshot` sequence drifts
when the page mutates between calls.

```bash
# Default: file output, wait for page quiescence, bounds included
curl "http://localhost:9867/capture"

# CLI alternative — writes the image locally and prints a summary
pinchtab capture -o /tmp/cap.jpg

# Half-size image (snapshot/bounds unchanged)
pinchtab capture --scale 0.5

# Fail with 409 if the main frame navigates mid-capture
pinchtab capture --require-pair

# Full-document image; bounding boxes in page coords
pinchtab capture --beyond-viewport

# Scope to one element: image clips to it, snapshot subtree filters to it.
# Bounding boxes are relative to the clipped image origin.
pinchtab capture -s "#checkout-form"
```

## What pairing guarantees

The atomicity contract is **"no main-frame navigation between the two CDP
calls"** — `pairing.navigated` flips to `true` when the main frame's
`loaderId` changes during the capture window. Drift inside the same
document (React re-renders, `IntersectionObserver` mutations) is not
detected; `wait=stable` reduces but does not eliminate it.

`epoch.domEpoch` is an opaque server-minted token cached on the tab's
ref-cache alongside the snapshot refs. Future action endpoints will accept
an `expectedEpoch` query param to reject stale refs at use time.

## Bounding boxes and coordinate space

When `withBounds=true` (the default), each snapshot node with a non-zero
backend node id gets a `boundingBox` and a `visible` flag, and a node that
cannot be measured gets neither.

`boundingBox` is the **border box** — the painted edge of the element, the
same rectangle `pinchtab box`, `screenshot?annotate=true` and
`getBoundingClientRect` report. Overlays and crop rectangles drawn from it
cover the control a viewer sees, and a box from `/capture` can be compared
directly with one from any of those surfaces.

The coordinate space depends on `selector` and `beyondViewport`:

- **`viewport`** (default): boxes are viewport-relative CSS pixels. The
  image is the visible viewport. `image.devicePixelRatio` tells you the
  ratio of image pixels to CSS pixels.
- **`clip`** (when `selector` is set): boxes are relative to the cropped
  image origin. The response also includes `image.clip` with the original
  document-relative clip rectangle.
- **`document`** (when `beyondViewport=true`): boxes use page coordinates
  (`box.x` and `box.y` include scroll offset). The image is the full
  document.

`visible` is true when the box has positive area and intersects the
viewport — a cheap heuristic, not a strict occlusion check. A node
scrolled past, in either direction, is measured and reports
`"visible": false`.

**Absent means not measured, never "no".** `visible` appears exactly when
`boundingBox` does, so the key is missing only where no measurement was
taken: `withBounds=false`, a node with no backend node id, or a node whose
box query failed. Treat a missing `visible` as unknown and a present
`false` as off-screen; they are different answers.

### `visible` here is not `GET /visible`

`GET /visible` (and `pinchtab visible <ref>`) answers a different question
under the same word: **CSS rendered-ness** — `display`, `visibility`,
`opacity`, and a laid-out or positioned box with non-zero size. **Scroll
position is not an input**, so an element far below the fold is `"visible":
true` there while this snapshot reports `"visible": false` for the same node
at the same moment. Both answers are correct and both are wanted: one says
the element is rendered at all, the other says it is on screen right now.

`GET /visible` also returns `onScreen`, which is this snapshot's predicate
computed for that one element, so a single call answers both questions.
`onScreen` follows the same absent-means-not-measured rule as `visible`
above.

## Useful flags

### API Query Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `tabId` | Target a specific tab |
| `selector` | Scope: clips image and filters snapshot subtree to the same element |
| `filter` | `interactive` (default) or `all` |
| `format` | `jpeg` (default) or `png` |
| `quality` | JPEG quality 0-100 |
| `depth` | Snapshot tree depth limit |
| `output` | `file` (default), `inline` (base64 in JSON), or `raw` (bytes only — drops the snapshot) |
| `wait` | `stable` (default) waits for `Page.lifecycleEvent` quiescence (250ms silence / 750ms ceiling); `load` polls `document.readyState` until `complete` (2s ceiling); `none` skips the wait |
| `withBounds` | `true` (default) — populate `boundingBox` (the border box) + `visible` on every measurable snapshot node; `false` omits both keys everywhere |
| `beyondViewport` | `true` — capture the full scrollable document; coordinate space becomes `document` |
| `scale` | Rescale the output bitmap. Default `1`. `0.5` halves each axis (quarter the pixels) |
| `requirePair` | `true` returns 409 if `pairing.navigated` would be true |
| `noAnimations` | `true` — inject `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS for the capture window |

### CLI

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-o <path>` | Save the captured image locally (default: `capture-<ts>.jpg`) |
| `-s <selector>` | Scope: clips image and filters snapshot subtree |

| `--format <fmt>` | `jpeg` or `png` |
| `-q <0-100>` | JPEG quality |
| `--depth <n>` | Snapshot depth limit |
| `--wait <mode>` | `stable` (default) / `load` / `none` |
| `--with-bounds` | Boolean (default true) |
| `--beyond-viewport` | Capture full document |
| `--scale <f>` | Bitmap rescale (e.g. `0.5`) |
| `--require-pair` | Fail with 409 on mid-capture navigation |
| `--tab <id>` | Target a specific tab |
