// Package fileout owns the no-overwrite rule for auto-named output files.
//
// Every auto-naming writer in this repo builds a name from a SECOND-resolution
// timestamp, so two outputs in the same second land on one path and the first is
// destroyed while the caller still reports that path and its byte count. Widening
// the timestamp only shrinks the window — two concurrent writers can share a
// millisecond — so the guarantee has to come from the create call itself.
//
// It lives here rather than in internal/handlers because the rule has two consumers
// that cannot import each other: the HTTP handlers and internal/cli/actions. A leaf
// depending only on the standard library is what both can reach. None of the existing
// shared packages owns filesystem output, and putting file creation in a sanitiser or
// an id generator would trade one small package for a responsibility violation.
//
// The boundary is generated default names only. A path the user typed is written as
// they typed it, overwrite included — that is their instruction, not a collision.
