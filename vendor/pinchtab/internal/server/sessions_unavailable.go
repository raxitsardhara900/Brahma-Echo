// Three states used to be one bare mux 404, so the CLI mapped all of them onto the only

// re-ran it forever. These codes exist so the caller can tell the states apart; the CLI
// branches on them rather than on the status, because keying off 404 is what conflated
// them and would conflate the next mode too.
